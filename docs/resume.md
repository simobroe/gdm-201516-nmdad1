>####School
>I have done 6 years of __Science and mathematics__ in middle school at Emmausinstituut Aalter. As of right now,  i am studying __Graphical and Digital media__ at Arteveldehogeschool Mariakerke. I always thought i would do something with science because i was very interested in it, but later on i discovered i didn't like how scientist wanted to know everything. After that i got interested in coding and started trying some html and css. After that i really wanted to become a web developper. I hope that i can become good and start my own little __web developping company__.

>##Portfolio
>I haven't made a lot of sites yet, but i'm very proud of the 3 sites i've already made.  
>
>The first one is my first site i've coded for the second school project of Web design. It was a one page website but it cannot be seen online.
>
>The second website i've made was for the third school project of Web design. It was a website for a imaginary festival called: "Rock Awesome". The whole project was done by me and i was very proud of how it looked. It also was the first website where i used some javascript and jquery.

>The third site i've made was not for a school project, but for a small grocery store in my home town. It is a one pager and has a very simple design. I really like how it looks and the next step is to make it responsive.
